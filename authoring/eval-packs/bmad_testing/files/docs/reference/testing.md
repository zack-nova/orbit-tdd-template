BMad provides two testing paths: a built-in QA workflow for fast test generation and an installable Test Architect module for enterprise-grade test strategy.

## Which Should You Use?

| Factor | Built-in QA | TEA Module |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Best for** | Small-medium projects, quick coverage | Large projects, regulated or complex domains |
| **Setup** | Nothing to install -- included in BMM | Install separately via `npx bmad-method install` |
| **Approach** | Generate tests fast, iterate later | Plan first, then generate with traceability |
| **Test types** | API and E2E tests | API, E2E, ATDD, NFR, and more |
| **Strategy** | Happy path + critical edge cases | Risk-based prioritization (P0-P3) |
| **Workflow count** | 1 (Automate) | 9 (design, ATDD, automate, review, trace, and others) |

:::tip[Start with built-in QA]
Most projects should start with the built-in QA workflow. If you later need test strategy, quality gates, or requirements traceability, install TEA alongside it.

## Built-in QA Workflow

The built-in QA workflow (`bmad-qa-generate-e2e-tests`) is part of the BMM (Agile suite) module, available through the Developer agent. It generates working tests quickly using your project's existing test framework -- no configuration or additional installation required.

**Trigger:** `QA` (via the Developer agent) or `bmad-qa-generate-e2e-tests`

### What It Does

The QA workflow (Automate) walks through five steps:

1. **Detect test framework** -- scans `package.json` and existing test files for your framework (Jest, Vitest, Playwright, Cypress, or any standard runner). If none exists, analyzes the project stack and suggests one.
2. **Identify features** -- asks what to test or auto-discovers features in the codebase.
3. **Generate API tests** -- covers status codes, response structure, happy path, and 1-2 error cases.
4. **Generate E2E tests** -- covers user workflows with semantic locators and visible-outcome assertions.
5. **Run and verify** -- executes the generated tests and fixes failures immediately.

The workflow produces a test summary saved to your project's implementation artifacts folder.

### Test Patterns

Generated tests follow a "simple and maintainable" philosophy:

- **Standard framework APIs only** -- no external utilities or custom abstractions
- **Semantic locators** for UI tests (roles, labels, text rather than CSS selectors)
- **Independent tests** with no order dependencies
- **No hardcoded waits or sleeps**
- **Clear descriptions** that read as feature documentation

:::note[Scope]
The QA workflow generates tests only. For code review and story validation, use the Code Review workflow (`CR`) instead.

### When to Use Built-in QA

- Quick test coverage for a new or existing feature
- Beginner-friendly test automation without advanced setup
- Standard test patterns that any developer can read and maintain
- Small-medium projects where comprehensive test strategy is unnecessary

## Test Architect (TEA) Module

TEA is a standalone module that provides an expert agent (Murat) and nine structured workflows for enterprise-grade testing. It goes beyond test generation into test strategy, risk-based planning, quality gates, and requirements traceability.

- **Documentation:** [TEA Module Docs](https://bmad-code-org.github.io/bmad-method-test-architecture-enterprise/)
- **Install:** `npx bmad-method install` and select the TEA module
- **npm:** [`bmad-method-test-architecture-enterprise`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bmad-method-test-architecture-enterprise)

### What TEA Provides

| Workflow | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Test Design | Create a comprehensive test strategy tied to requirements |
| ATDD | Acceptance-test-driven development with stakeholder criteria |
| Automate | Generate tests with advanced patterns and utilities |
| Test Review | Validate test quality and coverage against strategy |
| Traceability | Map tests back to requirements for audit and compliance |
| NFR Assessment | Evaluate non-functional requirements (performance, security) |
| CI Setup | Configure test execution in continuous integration pipelines |
| Framework Scaffolding | Set up test infrastructure and project structure |
| Release Gate | Make data-driven go/no-go release decisions |

TEA also supports P0-P3 risk-based prioritization and optional integrations with Playwright Utils and MCP tooling.

### When to Use TEA

- Projects that require requirements traceability or compliance documentation
- Teams that need risk-based test prioritization across many features
- Enterprise environments with formal quality gates before release
- Complex domains where test strategy must be planned before tests are written
- Projects that have outgrown the built-in QA's single-workflow approach

## How Testing Fits into Workflows

The QA Automate workflow appears in Phase 4 (Implementation) of the BMad Method workflow map. It is designed to run **after a full epic is complete** — once all stories in an epic have been implemented and code-reviewed. A typical sequence:

1. For each story in the epic: implement with Dev (`DS`), then validate with Code Review (`CR`)
2. After the epic is complete: generate tests with `QA` (via the Developer agent) or TEA's Automate workflow
3. Run retrospective (`bmad-retrospective`) to capture lessons learned

The built-in QA workflow works directly from source code without loading planning documents (PRD, architecture). TEA workflows can integrate with upstream planning artifacts for traceability.
